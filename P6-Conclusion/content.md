Congrats! You've just built your first iOS app.

You taken your first steps on your journey to become an iOS developer.

In this tutorial, you were introduced to many new concepts in Xcode and iOS development. To recap, you learned how to...

- create new Xcode projects
- use different tools of Xcode
- build simple user interfaces (UI) using _Interface Builder_
- connect storyboard to code with the _Identity Inspector_, IBOutlets and IBActions
- implement app logic for your Magic 8-Ball

# Where To Go From Here?

If it went by in a blur, don't worry. You'll need to keep practicing, but these steps will get drilled into your head once you go through the process on your own a few times...

Which leads us to your next challenge!

# A Challenge Approaches

To quote Zig Ziglar, "Repitition is the mother of learning."

To really learn iOS development, we'll have to put the new skills we learned to the test. To really learn the material, we'll want to keep repeating and practicing these foundational steps until we know them by memory.

## The Challenge

Coming up with new ideas of apps can be hard. To help out, you're going to creating a startup idea generator. This app will require many of the same skills and concept you learned during the Magic 8-Ball tutorial.

Try completing this challenge on your own. You should only refer back to the tutorial when you're stuck.

## App Design

Here are some screenshots for the final product. Feel free to get creative and add your style into app design.

## Specs

Similar to the Magic 8-Ball app, you're project will revolve around randomly generating content. This time around, you'll be generating new content for two labels.

The first label will be an array of existing startups. You can use the array below or generate your own:

```
["Uber", "Netflix", "Facebook", "Google", "Kickstarter", "Spotify", "Airbnb", "Snapchat", "YouTube", "Dropbox", "Amazon", "Craigslist", "Tinder", "Instagram", "Tesla", "Twitter", "SpaceX"]
```

The second label will be industries or categories. You can use the array below or generate your own:

```
["Dogs", "Books", "Gamers", "Star Wars", "Bitcoin", "Goats", "Zombies", "Rich People", "Swimmers", "Florida", "Vampires", "Dragons", "Internet of Things", "Mars", "Cryptocurrency", "Mosquito Repellent", "Fidget Spinners", "Sun Screen", "Water Bottles", "Lost Travellers", "Superheroes"]
```

Your app will generate new startup idea whenever the user taps the generate button or shakes the phone.

Good luck the challenge! Remember, you can look back on the tutorial if you get stuck.
